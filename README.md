# 18222757 Supporting Material
This is a repository submitted as a part of the CS6143 Summer Project by student 18222757.

Files inside final training results folder can be previewed using the jupyter notebook called Result_Data_Visualisation. These files are the results of training agents using PPO, GAIL, and PPO+GAIL

The jupyter notebook Demonstration_Data_Visualisation is used to showcase the data recorded that was used for imitation learning(GAIL).

Code used to create the environments and control the agents can be found in the Environments folder.
To fully open and use the code used in creating the environments it has to be opened inside Unity Enigne 2023.
This can be done by creating a new Unity project and replacing the "Assets" folder generated by unity with the "Assets" folder inside this repository. I had to reduce the size of the files uploaded and this is why this workaround is required.

To preview the scripts used for controlling and rewarding the agents you can navigate to Environments -> (Pick any environment) -> Assets -> Scripts
